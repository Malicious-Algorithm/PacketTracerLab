# PacketTracerLab
This repo is meant for me to study networking using CiscoPacketTracer and apply what i've learnt.

## How ? 
Setting up labs and connecting devices together, understanding how it's done behind scenes.

## Why ?
I understand that networking is a MUST within the CyberSec world. So i just watched NetworkChuck's YouTube Free CCNA vids. The way he explains OSI, TCP/IP, ARP, ICMP... is just fantastic! After that i went and downloaded Cisco Packet Tracer. A tool which you can install quite easy in Linux, MAC or Windows. I'm using Linux and the process of installation was a 'lil tricky however i wasn't gonna give up right?.

NetworkChuck provided a file which you can then import to CiscoPacketTracer tool, this file was a lab he did and explained very detailed. I picked up on everything he explained throughout the videos as much as i could. Downloaded the .pkz file and start following hin hands on as he was explaining.

I knew i had to play with CiscoPacketTracer along a bit by myself, i was curious to see if i could mimic his lab and get it to work. So let's just jump in!

Aqui es donde logro poner en practica todo lo que voy aprendiendo sobre networking y como funcionan las cosas que usamos todos los dias. Gracias a NetworkChuck (mencionado anteriormente) he podido comprender, en lineas generales, sobre networking. 

## Credits
Almost everything i've done here is thanks to [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/c/NetworkChuck). He's by far one of the best teachers on the internet about Networking/Hacking.
